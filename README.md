This project is a simple command-line Supermarket Billing System implemented in C++. It provides a variety of functionalities that allow administrators to manage products and buyers to make purchases. The system includes features for adding, modifying, and deleting product records, as well as generating receipts based on product selection.

### Features:
- **Administrator Functions**: Administrators can log in with an email and password to access a secure menu where they can:
  - **Add New Products**: Administrators can add new products to the database by specifying the product code, name, price, and discount.
  - **Modify Existing Products**: Allows administrators to update product details such as price, discount, and name.
  - **Delete Products**: Products can be removed from the inventory using their product code.
  - **Display Product List**: View a list of all available products in the supermarket.
  
- **Buyer Functions**: Buyers can:
  - **Browse and Buy Products**: View the available products and place an order by selecting product codes and quantities.
  - **Generate a Receipt**: After making selections, a receipt is generated showing product details, total amount, and applicable discounts.

### How to Use:
1. **Compile the Code**: Clone or download the source code and compile it using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. **Start the Application**: Execute the compiled binary to launch the Supermarket Billing System.
3. **Login as Administrator**: Enter a valid email and password (`email: 123`, `password: 123`) to manage the product inventory.
4. **Choose Buyer Options**: If you are a buyer, you can view the list of available products, place an order, and get a receipt.
